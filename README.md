Creating a copy of the Google homepage to practice HTML/CSS

Things to work on:
1) responsivity for the search bar and search buttons
2) learning how to create the hover effect on the Apps icon
3) adding the magnifying glass and microphone icons to be used as buttons
4) refactor to code to make it more DRY

Things I learned: 
1) making a footer/navbar is far easier to make using an unordered list and adjusting the items accordingly.
2) most of this exercise I knew how to do, but solidified a lot of concepts by completing it.
